Before you start merging,

check are you in the right branch or not.

To check, type,

git branch

if you are in the correct branch then that's fine.

if not, type

git checkout branch name

git branch

Now,

git pull origin master (or git pull origin branch name)

then type,

git merge branch-name (the branch name you want to merge)

Lastly, type

git push origin master

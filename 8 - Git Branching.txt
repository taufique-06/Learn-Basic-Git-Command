git checkout -b new branch name (Example: git checkout -b new-branch)

then type

git branch.

Now you should have two branch

1. master

2. new-branch

In order to switch the branch,

type,

git checkout master (git checkout file name)

then, 

git branch.

For branching, the process is exactly as same as

the process of pushing.

But when you type for pushing

git push origin master.

But when you have new branch, type branch new instead of master

Example:

git push origin branch-name

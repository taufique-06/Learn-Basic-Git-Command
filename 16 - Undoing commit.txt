First type,

git log --oneline.

Then decide where you would like to go or how many commits you wanna undo

**Undoing can be done in two ways:

  1.  Soft Reset
  2.  Hard Reset

2. Hard Reset will delete your work. 
In order to do that,

git reset --hard the ID (git reset --hard 45e4595)


1. Soft Reset will not delete the file but the commit will be gone
In order to do that,

git reset --soft origin/master or git reset --soft the ID
